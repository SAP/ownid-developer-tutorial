Welcome to the developer's guide and documentation portal of OwnID by SAP.

OwnID by SAP offers a password-less login to your website. It is using cryptographic keys to replace the password which are then being stored in the Identity Management System. The mobile phone becomes the user’s method of login as those cryptographic keys are stored on the user’s mobile.
