Welcome to the developer's guide and documentation portal of OwnID by SAP.

OwnID by SAP offers a password-less login to your website. It is using cryptographic keys to replace the password. The public part of the keys is then being stored in the Identity Management System while the private part is stored on the mobile device. As a result, the mobile phone becomes the userâ€™s method of login.
